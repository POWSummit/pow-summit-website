# About the Conference {.md-about-heading}

There have been mining conferences. There have been plenty of Bitcoin-only conferences, but to our knowledge there has never been a **pluralist conference with an overarching focus on POW and on blockchain fundamentals.**

The vast majority of people in the blockchain ecosystem were not around in the early days and have likely never heard the origin stories.

The POW Summit will bring together the **worldâ€™s top innovators, thought leaders and decision makers**, as well as members of the Litecoin, ETC and crypto mining communities for two days of amazing networking opportunities and exciting discussions around industry developments, technical innovations, public policy issues, and much more.
