			<h2>THE “BITCOIN RENAISSANCE”</h2>
			<p>
AKA “Bitcoin Season 2” has been underway for the last year or so and is an exhilarating validation of Bitcoin and POW in general for a broad set of use cases that have historically only happened on other chains. POW Summit 2024 will explain the cypherpunk fundamentals and value proposition of the major POW chains across the following thematic streams:

						<h3>Proof of Scale <span>(Bitcoin L2s & Sidechains) </span></h3>
						<p>
							In addition to the OG sidechains on Bitcoin, more than 30 projects have launched in 2024 using the term “Layer 2 Solution”. The terminology can be overwhelming, and prone to marketing hype. This track will focus on presenting technical and economic tradeoffs from the leading projects in the hottest sector of development and capital investment in this cycle.

						<h3>Proof of Utility <span>(Emerging Protocols & Utilities)</span></h3>
						<p>
							The movement of money is not the only type of information which gains value from a temporal record of undeniable cryptographic and thermodynamic on-chain commitments of data. This track will focus on emerging Protocols and Utilities competing for scarce block space on the base layer, as well as on L2’s.

						<h3>Proof of Sustainability <span>(Mining and Environment)</span></h3>
						<p>
							After Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake (POS), a common, misguided mainstream narrative is that POW is obsolete and harmful technology. This track will focus on how and why the censorship- and capture resistant technology of POW chains is the most ecological and efficient thermodynamic method for creating and securing maps of data in space and time. Establishing this truth is more urgent than ever in the face of hostile governments and regulators.

						<h3>Proof of Human Rights <span>(Privacy, Fungibility, Legal Issues)</span></h3>
						<p>
							Recent prosecutorial and legislative actions in the US and Europe have demonstrated that the credo "Cypherpunks write code" is more cogent and important than ever. This track will feature anything from cutting-edge technology, to commentary and future visions.
