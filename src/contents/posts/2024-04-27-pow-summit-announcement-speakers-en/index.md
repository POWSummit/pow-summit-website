Thematic Streams at POW Summit 2024

The “Bitcoin Renaissance” AKA “Bitcoin Season 2” has been underway for the last year or so and is an exhilarating validation of Bitcoin and POW in general for a broad set of use cases that have historically only happened on other chains. POW Summit 2024 will explain the cypherpunk fundamentals and value proposition of the major POW chains across the following thematic streams:

Proof of Scale (Bitcoin L2s and Sidechains) - This track will focus on presenting technical and economic tradeoffs from the leading L2 and sidechain projects.
Proof of Utility (Emerging Protocols and Utilities) - This track will focus on emerging Protocols and Utilities competing for scarce block space on the base layer, and L2’s.
Proof of Sustainability (Mining and Environment) - This track will focus on how and why the POW chains are the most ecological and efficient thermodynamic method for creating and securing maps of data in space and time.
Proof of Human Rights (Privacy, Fungibility, Legal Issues) - This track will feature anything from cutting-edge technology, to commentary and future visions.
